(Sprint 1)
This project was created by Charles Ashworth for COMP 490
This project pulls the information from the Wufoo survey using an API
There is an API key which will not be shared due to security purposes
   - Pulls information
   - Writes the pulled information in json to a "w_data.txt" file
   - Reads the file in the console

To my knowledge, there is nothing that this project is missing.
